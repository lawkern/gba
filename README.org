* Dependencies

- arm-none-eabi-gcc :: Download from your favorite package manager. Includes the
  GCC compiler toolchain for ARM targets. We use its versions of ~as~, ~gcc~,
  and ~objcopy~.

- make :: The build is handled by the top-level Makefile. In addition to
  building the ROM, it will use the host system's C compiler to compile the
  included ROM fixer.

- RetroArch :: Calling ~make run~ will execute the compiled ROM using the mgba
  core included with RetroArch. To use a different emulator, instead call:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make EMU=your_favorite_emulator run
  #+END_SRC
